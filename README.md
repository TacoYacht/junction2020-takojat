# A" Essentials

> Start working smarter, a more self-coordinated way and be well. Save your mind for the essentials in your life.

## Project Description

How great would it be if there existed an easy tool to organise your course schedule and easily track the time spent? What if you could see whenever fellow students are working on the same problems as you and allow you to communicate with them based on the common tasks? Are you already familiar with the bliss of working in POMODORO manner? 

With A" Essentials you can track your tasks, both personal and course related, in an intuitive way. Students enrolled on the courses can track time spent on each individual task, whether it's reading a chapter from the course book or finishing exercises.

The course staff will receive REAL data of how much students spent time completing course exercises. There is also possibility to send notifications if some of the tasks they have scheduled are taking longer for students to complete. This could be used to encourage people to seek help from course staff or other students in time before they tire out.
